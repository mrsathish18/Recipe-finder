# Recipe-finder
We’ll build a 2-page Recipe Finder website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The two pages will be: - Home Page (index.html) – Introduction, navigation, and overview of the Recipe Finder. - Recipe Page (recipe.html) – Displays recipes, allows searching/filtering, and shows detailed recipe information.
